# Photopy

A command line tool for importing photos into a hierarchical directory structure.

Example:

```
photopy -from /media/UsbStick -to ~/Photos -max-procs 6 -dry-run
```

The directory structure is generated according to the creation date found in the image's EXIF data.

An imported set of photos would look like this:

```
cd ~/Photos
find .
.
